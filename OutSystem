## - It is a low code which is used to build web and mobile applications
- It is a modern application development platform that will enable you to build web and mobile applications without writing lines and lines of codes. It is a low code show however, there is much more to the Outsystems platform than the just visual tools for development. The lack of speed and agility of traditional software development just doesnâ€™t meet the demand of the enterprise and the Outsystems platform accelerates the speed and agility of developing applications and it helps you decrease the cost and time to market.
- It helps you to integrate with your existing system and you can connect to the most common databases and other cloud services and enterprise systems, also Outsystems make it easy for the developers to consume and expose rest and soap-based web services (a messaging protocol for exchanging information between two computers based on XML over the internet) and tap into APIs to integrate with other systems, as all done visually and enabled with the sound architecture so that these patterns and components can be reused within the platform.
- If you can't find exactly what you need to develop your applications, Outsystems has an extended open source repository known as repository forge which is somehow similar to a Github specifically for Outsystems where you will find 3300 extensions, code modules, connectors and components to extend the capabilities of what you can do as a developer without writing the codes line by line.
- If you can't find exactly what you need on the forge and you have the skills you can extend the platform by writing your own custom code compiling that code to work in the Outsystems platform and then you can share that component across your teams.
- Outsystems deploys applications using standard optimized code on the Microsoft stack using .NET  and c-sharp behind the scenes.
- The Outsystems platform also provides a full devops solution that support continuous delivery, continuous integration of your application and it can also be integrated with your existing enterprise devops tools.
- You can create and debug applications visually test them directly on mobile devices or in the browser, deploy them across environments, capture feedback directly in the apps and monitor them in a sophisticated set of dashboards and management tools.
- The Outsystems platform enables teams like yours to create a wide range of rich and engaging digital experiences, as you can create user interfaces for both web and mobile applications using the exact same visual workflow 
- The platform has a rich beautiful UI framework that will enable you to create great experiences across platforms with best platforms with best practices built in which are reusable across channels which can be used to create your interfaces, adapt them or create your own for your brand consistency across your teams and applications as you have the full control over the user interface and also it is quite easy to include your own CSS  and Javascript if you already have pre-built components or styles that you want to leverage.
- The platform also allows you to expose APIs and services that power other experiences and connect you to other business applications easily.
